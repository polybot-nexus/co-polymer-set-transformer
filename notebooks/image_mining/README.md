Instructions:

1. To be able to run the code for absorption spectra segmenatation, you need to first download the checkpoints (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j7FYF6rBljLKdWcaUubO28KWM4eJvjdT/view?usp=sharing) folder, unzip it and and add it inside the Plot2Spec_materials_eyes

2. Install the dependences:
    pip install -r "requirements.txt"

3. Follow the plot2spectra_demo.ipynb demo for extracting the spectral lines

4. Run `python decimer_ai.py` to extract the smiles from the exemplar structure image. The expected output is located on the "monomer_structure_example/expected_output" folder
